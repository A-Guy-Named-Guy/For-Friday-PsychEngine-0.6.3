On a song that disallows combat, only a sing victory is possible,\n\nwhile some songs will force failure if the opponent is not defeated.\n\nAny song that ends in story mode will give a chance to restart the song for an alternative victory condition, and\n\nalso a note for if an ending has a particular effect, such as a required combat victory or an alternate ending.",
