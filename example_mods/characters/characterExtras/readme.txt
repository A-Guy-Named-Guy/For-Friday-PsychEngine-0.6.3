// Combat change
Put your character effect .json files here!

"Character Extras" are pretty much any additional sprites used for character animations.
Phrasing in the character editor uses the word "effect", but the system works for pretty much any sprite you want to be
a separate object from the main character.

Just name the animation you want to play the same as what it should appear on on the parent character.
For example, bf's "bfFace" effect have their animations named "combatBlockRIGHT", "combatBlockLEFT", etc. The same ones as
bf's dodge, or "block" animations.

Same thing for more effect-esque things, like bf's little mic smear.
