A character with a bash, for instance,\n\ncan use it for a few purposes, such as interrupting enemy attacks or specials, or functioning as an opener to guarantee\n\nan attack lands.\n\n\n\nENEMY SPECIALS\n\nEnemies, too, can have a special attack that is performed on the \"down attack\" note in their charting.\n\nThe effect of this special can make a core difference in how the enemy must be approached.\n\nThe Shrub, for instance, has a bash as his special attack.\n\nBashes deal stamina damage and prevent blocking for a short time. A simple attack.\n\n\n\nPressing the \"Down Guard\" key (most likely the button to hit a down note) causes you to dodge.\n\nThough the bash special is dodged using this input,\n\nnot all special attacks are countered with a dodge.",
