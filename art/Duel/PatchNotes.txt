Version 1.0.1

- Attack Input changes
	- Fixed attack inputs being dropped on attacking to a singing note synced with an enemy attack
		- This was a very stubborn issue throughout development, with several red-herring fixes
		- Confident it should be fixed now
	- Fixed note attacks not switching guard direction
		- This was related to an aforementioned red-herring fix
		- Simple-short of it is that an unnecessary step was cut out that now makes things work more consistently
- Source Code
 	- Renamed and rearranged a couple things in the Combat file
