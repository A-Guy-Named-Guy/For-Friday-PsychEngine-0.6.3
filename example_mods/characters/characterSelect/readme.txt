// Combat change
This characterArray.json controls which characters appear with which portraits/descriptions, etc. in the pre story mode character select

The purpose of this character select is to divide weeks amongst chosen characters, as weeks now have a "character" parameter
that restricts which week shows for which character.

There's a bool (true/false thingy you can flip in the characterArray json that disables using the screen outright,
skipping straight to the story menu.
This will also ignore the character parameter in character jsons and just put all weeks up as normal
